## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Removing pound signs from code output via setup chunk
Include comment = NA in the setup chunk to get rid of these.

## Add table of contents
With toc: TRUE in YAML header.

##Change the document margins
via geometry: setting in the YAML header,   
setting the margins overall or just some of the margins

## Make URL links visible
change the url color using the urlcolor: option in the YAML header

## Using eval and echo

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>%
group_by(cyl) %>%
summarise(mdisp = mean(disp) )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(mtcars %>%
group_by(cyl) %>%
summarise(mdisp = mean(disp) ) )
```

## Holding figures to end of chunk with fig.show

```{r, twoplots1}
plot(cars)
plot(pressure)
```

```{r twoplots2, fig.show = "hold", fig.width = 4}
plot(cars)
plot(pressure)
```
