This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Introduction to Markdown

The [RStudio cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) is agood resource, 
as is RStudioâ€™s [Markdown Basics page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html).

**Bold text** looks like **this**.

*Italic* text looks like *this*.

## Nested Bullete List

* First bullet
* Second bullet
    + Secondary bullet

Do you see the nested bullet list above?

## Nested Numbered Lists
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
    a. Item 2a
    b. Item 2b
3. Item 3

## Blockquotes
> Here is how to write a block quote 
as a single block of text even if it is written 
on multiple lines

> Here is the first block quote  
> Here is the second  
> end each above line with two or more spaces.

> Here is the first block quote.

Let's talk about $\sigma^2$ within a sentence, using the Greek letter.

And $\int_{a}^b f(x)dx$

## Display equation
Here is how we sum everything together: $$\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$ 
And \[ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx.\] 

## Page breaks
Force new pages by putting three or more dashes or asterisks on a line.
